{"name":"KiFooKatch","tagline":"","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppoo14152/KiFooKatch/master/proyecto%20OK/images/kfk.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Watch video on Youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO3rF3qV2yI)\r\n[Play on Greenfoot.](http://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/13932)\r\n\r\n### Thanks for your interest in KiFooKatch\r\nThis Kinect-based game is thought for teaching children the right way to eat, by controlling a boy to catch food falling from the sky.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to catch healthy food to add points, if the user catches junk food it will lose points instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kinect Implementation\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppoo14152/KiFooKatch/master/proyecto%20OK/images/Kinect_Sensor_Required_Logo.png)\r\n\r\nWe implement the Kinect classes to track a user and display it on the screen in a real-time process, and make a more interactive and interesant game for little children.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Food\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppoo14152/KiFooKatch/master/proyecto%20OK/images/uvas.png)\r\n\r\nAs the difficulty of the game increases the food fall will get faster and faster.\r\nAlso if the user happens to catch a determined amount of junk food, the game will be lost.\r\nHealthy food will make the user get health and energy points, just as in real life!\r\n\r\n### Kinect Requirements\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to have a Kinect sensor to play this game. Also you will need to have an USB adapter for the Kinect.\r\nIn order to run this project in your computer you will need to install the Kinect Software.\r\nPlease follow the instructions in this link.\r\nhttp://www.greenfoot.org/doc/kinect \r\n\r\nPlease be sure to download OpenNI, the NITE Framework, the Kinect drivers and the KINECT GREENFOOT SERVER (this one is available at the end of the greenfoot page).\r\n\r\nTo install the Kinect drivers in Windows 8.0 or 8.1 you need to restart your computer in advanced mode, in order to make this please follow the instructions in this link: http://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/\r\n\r\nAlso before running greenfoot please have your kinect connected and then run the Greenfoot Kinect Server (only search it and click it).\r\n\r\n###Warnings\r\n\r\nPlease stand about 2 metters apart from the Kinect, raising your arms.\r\n\r\nThere's message that aims to restart the project, but there is no need to as the world constructs within a few seconds, so please just ignore that message.\r\n\r\nThe kinect Software may stop working after a few compilations due to memory issues as well. To resolve this go to the Temporary file in your computer and delete all archives starting with GKT. Then you may reload the Greenfoot Kinect Server.\r\n\r\nIf you happened to erase all the temporary files, please install OpenNI again. Preferably all the Kinect drivers, too.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStudents of the UASLP, 2015.\r\nValeria Cortez (@tiffcortez)\r\nHugo Lim√≥n (@HugoLimon)\r\nWith classes downloaded from the Greenfoot Kinect page.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact?\r\nPlease feel free to contact us at:\r\ntiffcortez95@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
