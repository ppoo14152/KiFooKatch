{"name":"KiFooKatch","tagline":"","body":"### Thanks for your interest in KiFooKatch\r\nThis Kinect-based game is thought for teaching children the right way to eat, by controlling a boy to catch food falling from the sky.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to catch healthy food to add points, if the user catches junk food it will get fat instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kinect Implementation\r\nAs the Kinect classes are fairly new in GreenFoot we are learning how to use and implement them in a normal, non-kinect GreenFoot proyect.\r\nWe implement the Kinect classes to track a user and display it on the screen in a real-time process, and make a more interactive and interesant game for little children.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Food\r\nAs the difficulty of the game increases the food fall will get faster and faster.\r\nAlso if the user happens to catch a determined amount of junk food, the game will be lost.\r\nHealthy food will make the user get health and energy points, just as in real life!\r\n\r\n### Kinect Requirements\r\n\r\nYou need to have a Kinect sensor to play this game.\r\nIn order to run this project in your computer you will need to install the Kinect Software.\r\nPlease follow the instructions in this link.\r\nhttp://www.greenfoot.org/doc/kinect \r\n\r\n###Warnings\r\n\r\nOne person must be in front of the kinect sensor before running the proyect, only one person is allowed o play the game at once.\r\nPlease stand about 2 metters apart from the Kinect, raising your arms.\r\n\r\nIn the last commit appears to be an error at the construction of the world, the message aims to restart the project, but there is no need to as the world constructs within a few seconds, so please just ignore that message.\r\n\r\nThis projet seems to occupy a lot of memory, so if an error starts showing just close and re-open Greenfoot. \r\n\r\nThe kinect Software may stop working after a few compilations due to memory issues as well. To resolve this go to the Temporary file in your computer and delete all archives starting with GKT. Then you may reload the Greenfoot Kinect Server.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStudents of the UASLP, 2015.\r\nValeria Cortez (@tiffcortez)\r\nHugo Lim√≥n (@HugoLimon)\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact?\r\nWe will provide an e-mail adress soon!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
