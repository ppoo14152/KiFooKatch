{"name":"KiFooKatch","tagline":"","body":"### Thanks for your interest in KiFooKatch\r\nThis Kinect-based game is thought for teaching children the right way to eat, by controlling a boy to catch food falling from the sky.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to catch healthy food to add points, if the user catches junk food it will get fat instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Kinect Implementation\r\nAs the Kinect classes are fairly new in GreenFoot we are learning how to use and implement them in a normal, non-kinect GreenFoot proyect.\r\nWe implement the Kinect classes to track a user and display it on the screen in a real-time process, and make a more interactive and interesant game for little children.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Food\r\nAs the difficulty of the game increases the food fall will get faster and faster.\r\nAlso if the user happens to catch a determined amount of junk food, the game will be lost.\r\nHealthy food will make the user get health and energy points, just as in real life!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStudents of the UASLP, 2015.\r\nValeria Cortez (@tiffcortez)\r\nHugo Lim√≥n (@HugoLimon)\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact?\r\nWe will provide an e-mail adress soon!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
